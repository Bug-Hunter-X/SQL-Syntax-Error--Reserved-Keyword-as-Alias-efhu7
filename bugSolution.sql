To resolve this error, enclose the alias in double quotes or use a different, non-reserved name:

```sql
-- Using double quotes
SELECT order_date AS "DATE" FROM orders;

-- Using a different alias
SELECT order_date AS order_date_alias FROM orders;
```
The corrected query in `bugSolution.sql` avoids the syntax error by using a non-reserved name for the column alias.
