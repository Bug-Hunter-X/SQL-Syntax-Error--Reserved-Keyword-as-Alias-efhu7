This repository demonstrates a common SQL error: using a reserved keyword as a column alias. The `bug.sql` file contains the erroneous query, while `bugSolution.sql` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises because `DATE` is a reserved keyword in many SQL databases, preventing its use as a column alias without proper quoting or escaping. This example highlights the importance of understanding database-specific keywords and proper alias naming conventions to avoid syntax errors and ensure query correctness.
